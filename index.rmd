# Hi, Chelsey Su it is.
</center>

   I am a forth year geography student at University of California, Santa Barbara. 
   
   Through out my life, geography has been an interesting subject to me. As I am taking geographical information system course(Geog176A), I found out that coding made data analysis so much easier. I am now able to analyze some data and put them into figures through **Rstudio**.
